The most task relevant interval would be the period just prior to the response, when they are holding the item in memory and preparing to make a response. \n",

    "#### a. Divide the 1.5 sec interval (375 samples) after stimulus presentation into 3 intervals of length 0.5 second (125 samples) and compute the average amplitude spectrum for each angle from 0 to 360 for each of the 3 intervals.  So there are 3 intervals \n",

    "#### b. For visualization, we will focus on PO7 and PO8 over the left and right hemispheres respectively, and the angles 0 and 180 which are pointing to the left and right.   For each of the three intervals, make a separate graph for PO7 and PO8 plotting the amplitude spectrum of the EEG for stimuli in memory at angle 0 and angle 180.  \n",
