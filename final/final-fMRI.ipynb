    "# Final Exam Take Home (Part 1) - fMRI analysis\n",

    "#### **All files needed for the final are contained within the folder final**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Final Exam is divided into 2 parts.  The first part involves using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to analyze fMRI data related to working memory using a comparison of a **n-back (n=2)** task with **target detection**, using different types of visual stimuli known to activate different parts of the brain. In an n-back task, subjects are presented a sequence of stimuli. The task is to detect whether the stimuli are repeats with a separation of n items.  This task is popular in studies of working memory because the subject has to hold the last n stimuli in sequence in memory, and the load on working memory can be parametrically varied by increasing n. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The task here was designed to separately manipulate aspects of working memory.  First, the two tasks contrast the engagement of areas of the brain involved in working memory computations in the brain.  Second, the use of different types of visual stimuli involves different parts of the brain that process the stimuli and potentially hold separately the representation of the stimulus in working memory.  \n",

    "### The data for this task is in the file 'WM_fmri_subjectaverage.mat'.  The data has been averaged over fmri scans in each of 100 participants for each experimental condition. \n",
